# Configuration Files

This folder houses a copy of the configuration files that I use, for easily setup on a new system.

Both vim and nvim configs are set up with the [vim-code-dark](https://github.com/tomasiser/vim-code-dark) theme, so will need to install this prior to using the configs for either. Using the default installation instructions for nvim, create a ~/.vim symlink to the ~/.local/share/nvim/site folder.
